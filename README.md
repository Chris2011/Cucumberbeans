**This plugin adds to NetBeans support for Cucumber**. Cucumber is a tool for running automated acceptance tests written in a behavior driven development (BDD) style. You can use it to automate functional validation in a form that is easily readable and understandable to business users, developers and testers.

Cucumber lets software development teams describe how software should behave in plain text; and this text follows some conventions and keyword specified by a syntax called Gherkin. At the moment the feature supported for this langualge are:

* **Syntax Highlighting** (Colors, editable in the preference)
* **Navigation** of feature files (the navigator view)
* **A palette** to visually add new elements
* **Code Completion** (Triggered by Ctrl+Space)
* **Code Folding** (Folding on blocks like Feature, Scenario ...)
* **Code Formatting** (Triggered by Alt+Shift+F)
* **Language Templates** to create new .feature and .future files
* **Hints** to fix grammar errors
* **Code Navigation** go to the implementation of any step definition using hints
